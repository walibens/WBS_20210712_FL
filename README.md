# Performance phase - WBS_20210712_Foundation Level

## Week 1 - Convert Roman 
https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/application-katas/convert-roman/

### Day 1
The 1hour challenge was intense and not enough to handle all the kata

Before the one hour, I started by a 1st draft of Message & Data flow as described here

Then I did it in a TDD way with a focus on the structure of the program.

While I was creating the differents classes, I decided to update the Message-Data Flow with an interface implemented by ToRoman and ToArabic using the metho convert.

Tomorrow I'll try to prepare before the CRC Cards to see if the design could be enhanced

### Day 2
It was harder than yesterday although I've prepared the CRC cards. Maybe because I was trying to reproduce what I did well yesterday.
I felt like wasting time on some basic stuffs.

### Day 3
I've kept more or less the structure of day 1 and day 2 with a focus on the exception class.


### Day 4
As we can have an input file with roman/arabic numerals, I've added a new interface as a port and a new file class as an adapter to follow the hexagonal architecture



## Week 2 - Game of Life

### Day 1
The exercice seems to be tougher than the first one, maybe because I was focusing on how to deal with a variable grid.
Even the message and data flow diagram seems to me not clear, I guess it means I didn't understand well the need.

### Day 2
As I'm more confortable with ABAP Eclipse, I can see I write faster code.
However I'm feeling I'm burning steps, like not spending enough time in the test. I'll try for the day 3 to focus only on the test.
