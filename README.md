### Day 1
The 1hour challenge was intense and not enough to handle all the kata

Before the one hour, I started by a 1st draft of Message & Data flow as described here

Then I did it in a TDD way with a focus on the structure of the program.

While I was creating the differents classes, I decided to update the Message-Data Flow with an interface implemented by ToRoman and ToArabic using the metho convert.

Tomorrow I'll try to prepare before the CRC Cards to see if the design could be enhanced
